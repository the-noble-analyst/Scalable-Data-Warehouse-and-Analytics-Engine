# 📥 Why This Report Was Created

Modern businesses don’t struggle due to lack of data — they struggle because data often exists without meaning.

This Power BI report was built to answer one simple but powerful question:

> **"How can TwoWheels increase revenue by understanding who buys, what sells, and where to scale?"**

This document explains insights in a practical, market-driven manner — just as a business leader or recruiter expects.

# 🔍 What We Discovered

## 1. Revenue Dependency on a Few Markets  
The United States generates the highest sales — almost twice as much as others.  
This is good for stability but risky for scalability.

**Real-world implication:**
- If U.S. sales fall, the business feels the shock immediately.  
- We need new contribution from Germany, France, Canada & AU for balance.

**Opportunity:**  
Expand supply chain + region-focused marketing → reduce risk, increase reach.

---

## 2. The 41–60 Age Group is the Gold Mine  
This segment buys more than any other.

**Why this matters:**
- They likely have higher disposable income  
- They show interest in premium products  
- They are consistent, loyal purchasers  

**Business move:**  
→ Launch premium touring bikes, exclusive loyalty plan, luxury add-ons.  
Instead of chasing new customers blindly, double down on those who already trust the brand.

## 3. Bikes Sell — But Accessories Aren’t Getting Attention  
Bikes dominate revenue; Accessories & Clothing barely contribute.

This is unrealized money.

Even if **10–15%** of bike buyers add accessories/clothing → **AOV increases instantly**.

### Solution Ideas

| Strategy | Expected Impact |
|---------|-----------------|
| Bundle bikes + helmets/gloves | Higher average order value |
| Accessory discounts on repeat orders | Long-term retention |
| Season-based clothing launches | Fresh recurring revenue |

**Revenue growth already exists inside the customer 

---

## 4. Yearly Growth Exists, But It's Not Exponential Yet  
Sales trend is healthy, but the year-end dip can’t be ignored.

A dip is a story.  
And every story has a reason — seasonality, inventory, pricing shift, or marketing pause.

**Action:**  
Investigate Q4 patterns → adjust pricing, campaigns, delivery cycles accordingly.
